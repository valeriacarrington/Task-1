Running the Code:
You can run the code using any Python environment or IDE(Pycharm, Vscode)
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
Run the Python file using the command: python order_book.py.

Input:
The code simulates trading orders for buying and selling UAH (Ukrainian Hryvnia) using USD (United States Dollar) as the quote currency.
Each order is represented by the Order class, which includes user_id, amount, price, and side (whether it's a buy or sell order).
Example orders are provided in the Example usage section of the code.

Output:
The output of the code includes matched trades and balance changes for users involved in the trades.
Matched trades display the amount of UAH traded and the price at which the trade occurred.
Balance changes show the user ID, the value (in USD for buy orders and in UAH for sell orders), and the currency affected.
